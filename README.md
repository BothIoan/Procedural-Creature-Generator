## Description

This is my uni final project. I want to make a creature random generator using
the unity engine. This Readme will be (for now) a progress log.

## Step1

Got unity, managed to create a terrain 
-> Will make the walk inverse kinematic look better
-> Later It would be really nice if I gave the user some backgrounds to choose from

## Step 2>

I gotta learn how to create a rig in unity, and add it to the project. Unfortunately, this thing is usuallt made in blender. This video might be the solution:
