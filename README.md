# Procedural creature generator

##Description

The aim of this application is to procedurally generate skeletons of various creatures, using the unity engine

##Functionalities

* Creatures can be generated
* Walking, grabbing and head-movement animations are generated dynamically
* The creatures can be exported as .obj files

##Future updates
* Now working on integrating a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), in the generation process, to help the user generate more desirable 3D objects.
